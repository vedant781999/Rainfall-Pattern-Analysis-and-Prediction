# Rainfall-Pattern-Analysis-and-Prediction
Researched on the official dataset consisting of the rainfall pattern of India from 1901 to 2017 released by the Indian Government and applied various data mining techniques for its analysis and prediction.

Applied Linear Regression for predicting rainfall in the upcoming year and clustering techniques like K-Means and DBSCAN for identification of drought and flood-prone regions

Visualized the rainfall pattern using several plots including a cartographic projection of Spatio-temporal clustering and the insights obtained were used to predict crop shortages in some regions
